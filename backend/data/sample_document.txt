SUBJECT: Project Nexus Documentation Transfer

FROM: Sarah Chen, Chief Information Security Officer
TO: All Department Heads

It has come to our attention that the documentation for Project Nexus has been removed from our secure database at approximately 23:45 on April 14, 2023. The access logs indicate that the files were accessed using Administrator credentials, but no authorization for transfer was recorded in our systems.

Project Nexus contains sensitive intellectual property related to our upcoming quantum encryption technology, and its unauthorized disclosure could severely impact our competitive advantage in the market. The missing documentation includes:

1. Quantum Key Distribution Technical Specifications (QKD-TS-2023)
2. Nexus Architecture Design Document (NADD-v2.3)
3. Implementation Timeline and Milestones (ITM-Q2-2023)
4. Budget Allocation Spreadsheet (BAS-2023-Q2Q4)

We have initiated our standard security protocols and have temporarily locked down all external access to the database. The IT security team is currently conducting a thorough investigation of all access logs and system activities during the time period in question.

All department heads are requested to:
- Account for the whereabouts of all team members with Level 3+ clearance during the period of 22:00-00:30 on April 14-15
- Review any recent unusual access requests or behavior from team members
- Temporarily suspend sharing of any Project Nexus related information until further notice
- Report any suspicious activities directly to the security office

Please note that we recently onboarded three new staff members to the Project Nexus team:
- Dr. Alex Rodriguez (Quantum Physics Specialist)
- Maya Williams (Network Security Engineer) 
- Thomas Greene (Financial Analyst)

All three have completed standard background checks, but as a precaution, please review any system access granted to these individuals over the past 30 days.

An emergency meeting has been scheduled for 15:00 today in Conference Room A to discuss next steps. Attendance is mandatory for all department heads.

Remember: This information is strictly confidential and should not be discussed outside of secure channels.
